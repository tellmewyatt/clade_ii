		<h2>Performance Notes</h2>
		<h3>Explanation of Notation</h3>
		<p>The score is in a grid layout. Each part is provided with a visual representation of dynamics, articulation, and attack
		called an "envelope". This is the pink shape displayed behind the staff. Each performer starts to play either once the start countdown reaches
		0, or when the envelope reaches the left line on the screen. The loudest dynamic is represented when the top of the envelop reaches the top line of the staff. Silence is represented
		by an absence of the envelope. Additionally, the staff for each part will disappear while the part rests, and reappear 5 seconds before each entrance.</p>
		<p>The envelopes should be treated as general guidelines. Musicians are free to alter the envelopes or improvise rhythms as they see fit, as long as the general character lines up with envelopes currently being displayed. Rehearsals of the piece
		may involve discussion of what kind of alterations to make where.
		</p>
		<p>Additionally, players are encouraged to experiment with different timbres throughout the piece, as long as the main, notated pitch is evident in the sound. Thus, the use of techniques such as mutes, sul ponticello and others are encouraged.
		However, all timbral changes should either be gradual or take effect immediately at the instrument's entrance.</p>
		<h4>Special Notes for Pianists</h4>
		<p>Pianists can play the specified pitch in different octaves,
		as long as the predominant octave is the notated one. Additionally, some of the envelopes notated are not pianistic (crescendos and decrescendos). It is
		up to the pianist(s) to decide how to interpret these markings.</p>
